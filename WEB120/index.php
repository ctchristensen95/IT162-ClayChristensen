 <h3>About Me</h3>
 
 <p>My name is Clay Christensen. I was born in Austin TX and have lived in various places throughout the country such as New York and Nevada. I spent a couple years studying Computer Science in Toronto Canada. I have always had a passion for anything and everything tech. I am currently a student at Seattle Central College, and this is my 2nd Year here. I originally started pursuing general Computer Science but came to learn that I love web design. I am currently trying to finish my associate degree in web design. Some of my hobbies include building computers, playing video games, and streaming those games to a live audience on a website called twitch.tv. I love music, food, and trying all sorts of new things!   </p>
